# Canopy Homebrew Tap

This tap reserves names for tools in the Canopy ecosystem.

## Reserved Tools

- **stoma** - AI Execution Governor Runtime (in development)
- **petiole** - (reserved for future tool)
- **radicle** - (reserved for future tool)
- **xylem** - (reserved for future tool)
- **phloem** - (reserved for future tool)
- **cambium** - (reserved for future tool)

## Installation

```bash
brew tap canopy/canopy
```

## Current Status

These formulae are **stub placeholders** to reserve names. They install minimal binaries that indicate the tool is not yet released publicly.

To install a reserved tool (you'll get a message indicating it's not released):

```bash
brew install stoma
# or
brew install petiole
```

## Notes

- These are pre-release / internal tools
- The formulae will be updated when tools are ready for release
- This tap follows Homebrew conventions for name reservation
